# Hangman Game
## 1. Purpose of the project
Hangman is a Python terminal game, wich runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

## 2. How to play
 The user can play this game by entering commands into the terminal. They must guess the letters correctly and have six guesses. The word will appear as "----", but if the user guesses the right letter, then the letter will appear instead of "-.". When the user enters a letter they have already guessed before, or puts a character that is invalid, they get a warning and must guess again. The user must guess all the letters in the word to win.
